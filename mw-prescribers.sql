-- 1. a. Which prescriber had the highest total number of claims (totaled over all drugs)? Report the npi and the total number of claims.

SELECT p1.npi, total_claim_count, CONCAT(nppes_provider_first_name,' ',nppes_provider_mi,'. ',nppes_provider_last_org_name) AS name
FROM prescriber AS p1
LEFT JOIN prescription AS p2
	ON p1.npi = p2.npi
WHERE total_claim_count IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_claim_count DESC
LIMIT 100

-- b. Repeat the above, but this time report the nppes_provider_first_name, nppes_provider_last_org_name, specialty_description, and the total number of claims.
SELECT p1.npi, total_claim_count, specialty_description,CONCAT(nppes_provider_first_name,' ',nppes_provider_mi,'. ',nppes_provider_last_org_name) AS name
FROM prescriber AS p1
LEFT JOIN prescription AS p2
	ON p1.npi = p2.npi
WHERE total_claim_count IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_claim_count DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- 2. a. Which specialty had the most total number of claims (totaled over all drugs)?
SELECT SUM(total_claim_count) AS total_claims, specialty_description
FROM prescriber AS p1
LEFT JOIN prescription AS p2
	ON p1.npi = p2.npi
WHERE total_claim_count IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY specialty_description
ORDER BY total_claims DESC;

-- b. Which specialty had the most total number of claims for opioids?
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 1 END) AS opioid_claims,specialty_description
FROM prescriber AS p1
LEFT JOIN prescription AS p2
	ON p1.npi = p2.npi
LEFT JOIN drug AS d1
	ON p2.drug_name = d1.drug_name
WHERE total_claim_count IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY specialty_description
ORDER BY opioid_claims DESC;

-- c. Challenge Question: Are there any specialties that appear in the prescriber table that have no associated prescriptions in the prescription table?

-- d. Difficult Bonus: Do not attempt until you have solved all other problems! For each specialty, report the percentage of total claims by that specialty which are for opioids. Which specialties have a high percentage of opioids?

-- 3. a. Which drug (generic_name) had the highest total drug cost?
SELECT d1.generic_name, sum(total_drug_cost)::money AS drug_cost
FROM prescription AS p1
LEFT JOIN drug AS d1
    ON p1.drug_name = d1.drug_name
WHERE total_drug_cost IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY d1.generic_name
ORDER BY drug_cost DESC;

-- b. Which drug (generic_name) has the hightest total cost per day? Bonus: Round your cost per day column to 2 decimal places. Google ROUND to see how this works.
SELECT 
    d.generic_name,
    ROUND(SUM(p.total_drug_cost) / SUM(p.total_day_supply), 2) AS cost_per_day
FROM prescription p
JOIN drug d ON p.drug_name = d.drug_name
WHERE p.total_day_supply > 0  -- Avoid division by zero
GROUP BY d.generic_name
ORDER BY cost_per_day DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- 4. a. For each drug in the drug table, return the drug name and then a column named 'drug_type' which says 'opioid' for drugs which have opioid_drug_flag = 'Y', says 'antibiotic' for those drugs which have antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y', and says 'neither' for all other drugs. Hint: You may want to use a CASE expression for this. See https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-case/
SELECT drug_name,
	CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'opioid'
	WHEN antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'antibiotic'
	ELSE 'neither'
	END AS drug_type
FROM drug

-- b. Building off of the query you wrote for part a, determine whether more was spent (total_drug_cost) on opioids or on antibiotics. Hint: Format the total costs as MONEY for easier comparision.
SELECT sum(total_drug_cost)::MONEY,
	CASE WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'opioid'
		WHEN antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'antibiotic'
		ELSE 'neither'
		END AS drug_type
FROM drug
LEFT JOIN prescription AS p1
	ON drug.drug_name = p1.drug_name
GROUP BY drug_type

-- 5. a. How many CBSAs are in Tennessee? Warning: The cbsa table contains information for all states, not just Tennessee.
SELECT *
FROM cbsa
WHERE cbsaname LIKE '%TN%';

-- b. Which cbsa has the largest combined population? Which has the smallest? Report the CBSA name and total population.
SELECT cbsaname, sum(population) AS total_pop
FROM cbsa
LEFT JOIN population AS p1
	ON cbsa.fipscounty = p1.fipscounty
WHERE population IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cbsaname
ORDER BY total_pop DESC;

-- c. What is the largest (in terms of population) county which is not included in a CBSA? Report the county name and population.

-- 6. a. Find all rows in the prescription table where total_claims is at least 3000. Report the drug_name and the total_claim_count.

-- b. For each instance that you found in part a, add a column that indicates whether the drug is an opioid.

-- c. Add another column to you answer from the previous part which gives the prescriber first and last name associated with each row.

-- 7. The goal of this exercise is to generate a full list of all pain management specialists in Nashville and the number of claims they had for each opioid. Hint: The results from all 3 parts will have 637 rows.

-- a. First, create a list of all npi/drug_name combinations for pain management specialists (specialty_description = 'Pain Management) in the city of Nashville (nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'), where the drug is an opioid (opiod_drug_flag = 'Y'). Warning: Double-check your query before running it. You will only need to use the prescriber and drug tables since you don't need the claims numbers yet.

-- b. Next, report the number of claims per drug per prescriber. Be sure to include all combinations, whether or not the prescriber had any claims. You should report the npi, the drug name, and the number of claims (total_claim_count).

-- c. Finally, if you have not done so already, fill in any missing values for total_claim_count with 0. Hint - Google the COALESCE function.
